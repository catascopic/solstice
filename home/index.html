<h1>2020 Maryland Solstice: Home</h1>


<p>In 1918, a pandemic surged across the world, infecting almost one third of the population, and killing 50 million.  The people of this era struggled to contain the spread of the virus, and to treat the sick without access to a cure.  They also struggled with the isolation that their new way of life required of them.

<p>Today, we face another global pandemic that has killed over 1.6 million people.  Our medical technology has improved vastly, and a vaccine is on the way, though many of our problems are the same.  But we do have one new form of technology that has made this all quite a bit more bearable: the internet.

<p>Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 (well, he received the patent for it, at least), and by 1918 about a third of all American households owned one.  When the pandemic hit, the telephone was heralded as a potential savior of the quarantine era.

<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t really pan out.  The telephones back then required operators, who had human bodies, and were as likely to get the virus as anyone else.  And the infrastructure just wasn’t up to the task of handling every stuck-at-home person’s call at once.  Telephones eased the difficulties a bit, but they were far from an antidote to isolation.

<p>And neither is the internet. Everyone likes to complain about how much the year of the Zoom call sucks, and, well, it does suck.  Video calls are still no substitute for interacting in person.

<p>But tonight, we will pause to appreciate what we have, by reflecting on what life would be like without the superconnectivity that we take for granted.

<p>Actually, we’re going to be doing a bit more than simply reflecting on it.  

<p>In 1918, telephones weren’t the only means of communicating long distances.  Electrical telegraphs were in wide use, and if you were a skilled operator, you might have a decisive advantage in your ability to keep in touch with your friends (assuming they were telegraphers too).  Let's take a moment to imagine what that might be like...
